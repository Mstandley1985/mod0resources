1. medium.com had a really nice description of the process of a collaborative github workflow. Explained it in a very simple manner, and helped me to understand how the process works. They have many other helpful resources as well.

2. Slack is proving to be a remarkable tool as well. Allows us to stay in touch with ease. Removes the "remote learning" feel just a bit. Fellow students as well as alumni are quick to respond and help when you're completely stuck.

3. Rectangle is very nice, too. Helps me keep my desktop nice and tidy. Makes it easier to work with more efficiency.

4. I'm really impressed with how well Zoom has worked as well!
